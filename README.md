# Final Project - Healthy Meal Planner:
This is the front-end for a meal planner app.

## Description
The meal planner is a full-stack web app. A team of four developers and one UI/UX designer worked to develop/design it.

The goal is to develop the basic features for a meal planner that helps people plan healthier meals more efficiently.

The idea of the app is to generate for users one recipe per day randomly from the database, the ability to change the recipe associated to a day and to print a shopping list based on all the recipes selected for the week.

### Some features of the apps:
- creating user accounts
- generating a list of recipes
- generating a shopping list that included all the necessary ingredients in the right quantity (calculated for the number of household members)
